### Analyzing the Impact of Climate and Population Dynamics on Water Storage Levels in Masinga Dam, Kenya

A Case Study of Hydrological Trends, Weather Patterns, and Population Growth in Machakos County

### Project Overview
This project investigates the interplay between climatic factors—specifically temperature and precipitation—and population dynamics on the water storage levels of Masinga Dam, a critical water resource in Kenya. Using data collected over multiple years, including reservoir water levels, daily weather conditions, and population statistics from Machakos County, this study aims to understand how environmental and human factors collectively influence the availability and sustainability of water in the region. The findings will provide insights for water resource management, helping policymakers and stakeholders make informed decisions in the face of climate variability and increasing population pressures.

### Problem Statement
Kenya faces growing challenges in managing its water resources due to climate variability and increasing population demands. Masinga Dam, one of the key reservoirs supporting water supply, irrigation, and hydropower generation, has experienced fluctuations in water storage levels. These fluctuations are influenced not only by changing weather patterns such as temperature and precipitation but also by rising population pressures in nearby counties like Machakos. This project seeks to quantify and analyze the combined effects of climate and demographic factors on Masinga Dam’s water levels, addressing the critical need for integrated water management strategies that account for both environmental and socio-economic drivers.

### Research Questions
What are the seasonal trends in water storage levels at Masinga Dam from 2018 to 2024?

How does precipitation influence water levels in Masinga Dam?

What are the impacts of extreme temperature events on dam water levels?

How does the water level uncertainty (wse_u) vary with seasonal and weather changes?

How does population growth in Machakos County affect water demand and usage in the Masinga Dam catchment area?

How might changes in household size and number of households influence future water demand projections?

How do temperature and precipitation jointly affect water level uncertainty over time?
