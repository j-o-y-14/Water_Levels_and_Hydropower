# Water Reservoir Levels & Hydropower Reliability: A Case Study of Masinga Dam, Kenya
## Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between reservoir water levels, rainfall patterns, and hydropower generation at Masinga Dam, Kenya’s largest dam and a key component of the Seven Forks hydropower scheme. By combining data on water levels, precipitation, and hydropower output, the study aims to assess how natural and environmental factors influence energy reliability. The analysis will explore trends, correlations, and potential risks to hydropower stability, providing insights for sustainable water and energy management in Kenya.

## Problem Statement
Kenya’s electricity supply relies heavily on hydropower, with Masinga Dam serving as both a major water storage facility and an essential power generator. However, fluctuations in rainfall and changing climatic conditions have led to significant variations in reservoir levels, directly impacting hydropower output. Without a clear understanding of how these factors interact, energy planners face challenges in ensuring a stable and reliable electricity supply. This project addresses the gap by analyzing historical water level, rainfall, and hydropower generation data for Masinga Dam to identify patterns and vulnerabilities that could affect long-term energy reliability.

## Research Questions
How have Masinga Dam’s water levels changed over time between 2018 and 2020?

What is the relationship between seasonal rainfall patterns and Masinga Dam’s reservoir levels?

How does Masinga Dam’s water level impact its hydropower generation output?

Are there observable lag effects between rainfall events and changes in reservoir water levels?

How do extreme high or low water levels affect the consistency of electricity generation?

Which months or seasons show the highest and lowest combined rainfall, water levels, and power output patterns?

How do hydropower generation trends align with both rainfall and water level variations over time?

## Methodology
Step 1: Data Collection
I will use Python and APIs to collect data from:

Reservoir Water Level Data – DAHITI Database

Rainfall Data – CHIRPS Climate Data or World Bank Climate Data API

Hydropower Generation Data – KenGen Annual Reports or OpenAFRICA Energy Datasets

Step 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Use Python (Pandas/Numpy) to clean datasets, standardize formats, and merge by date.

Remove missing or inconsistent entries.

Store cleaned datasets in a SQL database for structured querying.

Step 3: Visualization & Analysis
Use Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) for:

Time-series analysis of water levels, rainfall, and hydropower generation.

Correlation analysis between the three datasets.

Identification of seasonal patterns and extreme values.

Interactive dashboards and graphs for better exploration.

Use GeoPandas if spatial mapping is required for rainfall distribution.

Step 4: Dashboard Creation
Use Tableau to create an interactive dashboard summarizing findings.
